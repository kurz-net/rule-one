# Chapter 9

## numbers to calculate the value price
- current eps
- future eps growth estimate
- future PER (price earnings ratio) estimate
- min. profit rate

## short version
1. calculate the future eps by letting the current eps grow by 10 years by the eps growth estimate.
2. calculate the future market price by calculating the future eps by the future kgv
3. calculate the value price by lowering the future market price by the min. profit rate

## calculating the value price
- if the future eps growth estimate is way higher than the historical eps growth rate, take the lower (more conservative) number
- also called "earnings estimate"

- kgv = stock price / eps
- standard kgv = 2 x future eps growth estimate
  f.e. if the company is expected to grow by 10% in the next year, the std kgv would be 20
- if the historical kgv is smaller, take the more conservative number

- divide value price by 4 to get the MOS price
- divide the MOS price by 2, that's the price you should buy the stock at

# Chapter 10

## when you should sell
- the company isn't "wonderful" anymore (bad management, scandal, new ceo, leaks, ...)
- the market price surpassed the MOS price
